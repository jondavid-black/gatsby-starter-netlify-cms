When I reach for my morning coffee, I enjoy it with a spoonful of sugar.  I know there are some who would say "just learn to drink it black" but I really enjoy that rich smooth flavor without compromising on the bitterness.  

In the end, I really just want to start my day on a happy note.  Coffee with sugar is a great way to do that.
